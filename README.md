# Promueva Research Repository

This repository is part of the Promueva research project: **"Computational Models of Social Networks Applied to Polarization in Valle del Cauca"**. It stores and organizes key reference articles used in *Objective 1* of the project, focusing on various aspects of social network analysis and polarization studies.

## Repository Structure

The articles are organized into three main categories:

- **Opinion Evolution**: Articles analyzing how opinions form, evolve, and change within social networks or communities.
- **Polarization**: Research on processes leading to social polarization, how polarization manifests in social media, and its consequences.
- **Data**: Studies related to data collection, processing, and analysis for social networks or online behavior relevant to studying polarization and opinion evolution.

Each category contains folders for individual articles, which include a LaTeX-generated PDF document detailing important information about each reference.

## Article Documentation
